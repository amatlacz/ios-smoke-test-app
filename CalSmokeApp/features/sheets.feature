Feature: Sheets
In order to demonstrate interactions with sheets
As a Calabash maintainer
I want some Scenarios that show Calabash working with sheets

# These are sheets that are presented by _your_ application using:
#
#   UIActionSheetView *sheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc] ...];
#   # Action sheets can be anchored in many ways; this is
#   # just an example.
#   [sheet showFromTabBar:self.tabBarController.tabBar];
#
# These are _not_ sheets generated by the OS on behalf of your
# app.  An example of sheet present by the OS on behalf of your
# app is the sheet that appears when you try to cancel an email
# message.

Background: Navigate to the special tab
 Given I see the special tab

@animations
Scenario: Touch OK button on a sheet
  When I touch the show sheet button
  Then I see a sheet
  Then I see the "Smoke Test!" sheet
  And I wait for all animations to stop
  And I can dismiss the sheet with the Cancel button
